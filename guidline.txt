c++ dev tools 

1.editor 
    vs code
2.cpp compiler
    compiler makes a human redable code to machine readable code means binary code.

main(): this is a special type function which a entry point of the program.
statement of inside the main function is executed according its sequence.
statements are execute in top to bottom order.

comments
========

//single line comment
/*
block comment

multiple line comments 
comments are special symbols which tells compiler that no need to execute the lines
which are inside the comments. 

comments are specially created for devlopers to understand the meaning or need of that line of code.


nesting of the comments makes errors which are very hard to solve.

Errors and warnings 
==================
1 compile time errors
=> problems in the problems which comes at the time of compilation of the program,
such as syntax errors .

2 run time errors
=> this errors occures when the program is successfully compiled and generate execuatable code,
but it contains some logical errors and we not getting desired output.

3 warnings
=> program runs but warns that there is an issue and you should solve it otherwise it will be 
a large problem.
like 20/0

statement
=======
A statement is a basic unit of computation in cpp program.
Every cpp program is a collection of statements orgnized in a certain way to achive some goal.
statement ends with semicolumn ; in cpp.


input/output
==========
std::cerr  => printing errors to the console.
std::clog  => printing log messages to the console.

cin >> inputs a string until and unless it encounters a space so its cant take a whole string as input ,
so we uses getline()to take string as a input which contains whitespace.

getline(cin,nameof_variable);
