c++ dev tools 

1.editor 
    vs code
2.cpp compiler
    compiler makes a human redable code to machine readable code means binary code.

main(): this is a special type function which a entry point of the program.
statement of inside the main function is executed according its sequence.
statements are execute in top to bottom order.

comments
========

//single line comment
/*
block comment

multiple line comments 
comments are special symbols which tells compiler that no need to execute the lines
which are inside the comments. 

comments are specially created for devlopers to understand the meaning or need of that line of code.


nesting of the comments makes errors which are very hard to solve.

*/
Errors and warnings 
==================
1 compile time errors
=> problems in the problems which comes at the time of compilation of the program,
such as syntax errors .

2 run time errors
=> this errors occures when the program is successfully compiled and generate execuatable code,
but it contains some logical errors and we not getting desired output.

3 warnings
=> program runs but warns that there is an issue and you should solve it otherwise it will be 
a large problem.
like 20/0

statement
=======
A statement is a basic unit of computation in cpp program.
Every cpp program is a collection of statements orgnized in a certain way to achive some goal.
statement ends with semicolumn ; in cpp.


input/output
==========
std::cerr  => printing errors to the console.
std::clog  => printing log messages to the console.

cin >> inputs a string until and unless it encounters a space so its cant take a whole string as input ,
so we uses getline()to take string as a input which contains whitespace.

getline(cin,nameof_variable);

//cpp execution model 
sorce code => compiler => binary file => machine execute

program is on hard drive in the binary formate after compilation
RAm=> runs our program and all the addresses are given on the ram.

1. c++ core language 
=> this are basic building block of the program. basic needs of the program.
the basic rules how to create a cpp program. which is foumdation of cpp program.

2.standerd library
=> this feature provides the basically needed function to make a cpp program.
like iostream , math . string

3. stl
=> standerd library its collection of container types 

variables
=========
this are the special type of containers which contains similar type of data.
like int , bool , float, char ,double, void ,auto , long , short.


opraters
========
    operators are nothing but some special signs and symbols that tells the compiler to do some oprations.

    1. Arithmetic opraters
        1binary +,-,*,/,% 
        2unery ++ , --
        
    2. Relational operators : defines a relation bw 2 operands
        Return a boolean value.
        ==
        !=
        >
        <
        >=
        <=
    3.logical operators : used to connect multiple conditions/expressions togather or to reverse logocal value.
        &&
        ||
        !

Function: 
======      functions a piece of code that performs a specific taks.

syntax:

return_type function_name(no_of_params along with data types ){
    //function body 
}
=. we pass the values , not variables themself, local variables are created inside the function which are destroyed on returning from the function .


array : its list of variables of similar type of data. in countinues memory allocation. array reserves memory in the RAm using size.
To access element of the array we uses its indexing. In most of the languages array indexing starts from 0.

{1,2,3,4,5,4,2,3}
{'c','d','e'}

datatype arrayname [size] ={vals};

sorting : sorting is a technique to arrange elements in assending or decending order. 
    sorting techniques :
    Selection Sort : Find the minimum element in unsorted array and swap it with element at beginning.

    Bubble Sort : repetedly swap two adjacent elements if they are in wrong order. in every iteration we got last sorted element.

    insertion sort : insert an element from unsorted array to its correct position in sorted array.
                    there will be two arrays in insertion sort.


2D arrays : declaration of array inside the array is called 2D array. Its like matrix.
datatype array[size_row][size_col];

charecter Array : an array which is collection of charecters.
declaration : char array[size +1];//wheres last charecter is '/0' this called null charecter. which tells the word has finished.
"rahul/0"; this null charecter used for understand seltence end.

char array space as input :

cin.getline(arr,n); //takes sentance as input pass params array_name , size_of_array.
cin.ignore();//used to clear buffer.

Pointers : ponters are special type of variables which stores address of another variables.
it used * as address of pointer. too insert address of another variable we uses &(address of variable ).

int *prt;   //here we used int as data type of pointer because we want to store a int type of variable's address.
prt = &a;
cout<<*pprt<<endl;// this is called derefrencing.

we uses pointer so using pointer we can modify value of that variable indirectly.

In Pointers we can do some arithmetic oprations :
 ++, -- , + ,-.

 arrays itself are pointers .
 pointer to pointer 
 =================
 *p =&val;
 **q=&p;

 pass by refrence : when in function we passes address of the valrible insted of its value so it may assess using pointers
 and modification using pointer wil be happen in real variable is called pass by refrence.
